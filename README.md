# 🔢 React Counter App

A simple counter app built using **React** — my first hands-on mini project to explore core React concepts like state management and event handling.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Increase, decrease, and reset the counter
- Counter doesn't go below 0 (disabled button)
- Clean UI with glassmorphism effect

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Creating and using **functional components**
- Managing state with **`useState`**
- Handling user events using **`onClick`**
- Conditional rendering (disable buttons at a condition)
- JSX structure and component rendering

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React (via `create-react-app`)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
